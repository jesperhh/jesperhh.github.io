This is the homepage of Jesper Helles√∏ Hansen, a twenty-something software developer from Copenhagen, Denmark. 

I am currently employed at [BK Medical][], where I write software for ultrasound scanners. While I studied for my degree Computer Science and Technology at the Technical University of Denmark, I worked at [Radiometer Medical][], making web applications for internal use.

In my spare time, I enjoy riding and tinkering with bicycles. Even though I now work with software development, I also still spend far too much time in front of a computer at home,  programming, reading [reddit][] and [Hacker News][], and playing games.
