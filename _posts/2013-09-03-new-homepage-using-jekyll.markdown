When I moved the oktet.net domain from [Servage][] to [Unoeuro][] in 2010, I originally intended to write a small blogging/cms framework to make updating this page easy. I had been running Wordpress for a while, but found it overkill for my needs. I did not need the many features it provided, and having to keep it updated and the comments free of spam was tiresome. Instead, the page turned into 3 years of an ugly static website.. After reading lots of posts about static webpage generators on [Hacker News][], I decided that it would be a good compromise between ease of use and low maintenancen. 

The choice fell on [Jekyll][] with [Github Pages][], as this saves me from running the generator when the content is updated, and gives me version control of the page for free. Armed with these new tools, I hope to resurrect this site, and use it as a place to share small tips & tricks and possibly hobby projects.
